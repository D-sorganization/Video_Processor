## 💡 Critical Success Factors

### Do This:
✅ **Start with MVP** - Don't build everything at once
✅ **Talk to coaches constantly** - Build what they need
✅ **Make sharing frictionless** - This is your viral loop
✅ **Charge early** - Validate willingness to pay
✅ **Focus on UX** - Coaches aren't tech experts
✅ **Ship fast, iterate** - Don't wait for perfection

### Avoid This:
❌ Building all features before launch
❌ Building desktop/mobile apps before web
❌ Training custom AI models initially
❌ Premature optimization
❌ Skipping user validation

## 🎨 What Makes This Platform Special

### Your Competitive Advantages:
1. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Automatic pose detection (most competitors require manual markup)
2. **3D Visualization** - Swing plane overlays (unique feature)
3. **Physics Models** - Pendulum fitting for biomechanics (advanced)
4. **Easy Sharing** - Frictionless coach-to-student workflow
5. **Browser-Based** - No downloads, works anywhere
6. **Audio Commentary** - Record while playing (better than text notes)

### Market Opportunity:
- **Addressable Market**: ~28,000 PGA professionals in US
- **Pricing**: $29-79/month per coach
- **Potential**: $100k-500k+ ARR with 300-500 paying coaches
- **Moat**: AI + 3D features are hard to replicate

## 🤔 Decision Framework

### Should I start with MVP or build everything?
**Answer**: Start with MVP
**Reason**: Validate market fit first, iterate based on feedback

### Should I hire agency or build in-house?
**If you have**:
- $150k+ budget & want fast (6 months) → **Agency**
- Technical co-founder or are technical → **In-house**
- Want to validate first → **Hybrid** (MVP with agency, then hire)

### Should I use MediaPipe or train custom models?
**Answer**: MediaPipe first
**Reason**: 90% accuracy out-of-box, free, proven

### Should I build 3D features in MVP?
**Answer**: No
**Reason**: Validate core video analysis first, 3D is Phase 3

### What pricing should I use?
**Answer**: Freemium subscription
**Reason**: Free tier = viral growth, paid tiers = revenue, ongoing value = ongoing payment

---

## 🛠️ Technical Validation

### Can all features be built in a web browser?
**Yes** ✅
- Video processing: FFmpeg.wasm (WASM = native speed)
- AI pose detection: MediaPipe (runs in browser)
- 3D visualization: Three.js (WebGL)
- Drawing: Fabric.js (Canvas API)

### Will it be fast enough?
**Yes** ✅
- Pose detection: 30+ FPS on modern hardware
- Video processing: Similar to desktop apps (WASM)
- 3D rendering: 60 FPS with Three.js

### Will it scale?
**Yes** ✅
- Serverless architecture (Vercel) scales automatically
- Database (PostgreSQL) scales to millions of records
- CDN handles video delivery globally
- Can move to dedicated servers if needed
