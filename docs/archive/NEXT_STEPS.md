### Critical: Install Node.js

**Before we can continue**, you need Node.js installed:

1. **Download**: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version)
2. **Install**: Use default options
3. **Verify**: Open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v18+
   npm --version   # Should show v9+
   ```

4. **Then come back** and we'll continue!

## 🎯 Development Approach

### As a First-Time User of These Languages

**Don't worry!** I'll guide you step-by-step.

### Key Principles:

1. **Learn by Doing**
   - Start building simple components
   - I'll explain as we go
   - You'll learn gradually

2. **Start Small**
   - Build one feature at a time
   - Test after each feature
   - Don't try to understand everything at once

3. **Ask Questions**
   - If something is unclear, ask!
   - I'm here to help
   - There are no stupid questions

### Similarity to Python:

Since you know Python, TypeScript/JavaScript will feel familiar:

**Python**:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**TypeScript** (similar!):
```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

**Differences**:
- Uses `{}` instead of indentation
- Uses `const` instead of dynamic typing
- Similar function concepts
- Similar async/await
