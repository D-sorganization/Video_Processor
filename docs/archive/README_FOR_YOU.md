## 🎯 Your Questions - Answered

### 1. "Where are the costs coming from?"
**Answer**: The $140-210k is ONLY if you outsource. If you're developing yourself:
- ✅ **Development cost = $0** (your time)
- ✅ **Monthly cost = $1-2/month** for MVP
- ✅ See `docs/GOLF_VIDEO_BUDGET_GUIDE.md` for details

### 2. "What programming languages?"
**Answer**: Primarily **TypeScript/JavaScript** (95% of code)
- ✅ Similar to Python (you'll pick it up fast!)
- ✅ See `docs/GOLF_VIDEO_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES.md`

### 3. "Can I build entirely in MATLAB?"
**Answer**: Not recommended for web platform, but you can **use MATLAB for physics modeling**!
- ✅ Develop Simscape models in MATLAB
- ✅ Export results to JSON
- ✅ Web platform imports results
- ✅ Users access via browser (no MATLAB needed!)
- ✅ See `MATLAB_ONLY_ANSWER.md` for details

### 4. "VS Code packages?"
**Answer**: I've configured 14 recommended extensions!
- ✅ See `VS_CODE_SETUP.md` for complete list
- ✅ Extensions configured in `.vscode/extensions.json`
- ✅ VS Code will prompt you to install them

## 🚀 Next Steps - RIGHT NOW

### ⚠️ First: Install Node.js

You MUST install Node.js before we can continue:

1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Download**: LTS version (recommended)
3. **Install**: Use default options
4. **Restart**: Your terminal
5. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v18+
   npm --version   # Should show v9+
   ```

### Then: Install Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /c/Users/diete/Repositories/Project_Template

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

This will take 2-5 minutes the first time.

### Then: Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

## 📖 Reading Plan (While Node.js Installs)

While Node.js downloads/installs, read these in order:

### Must Read (30 minutes)
1. **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** ⭐ START HERE
2. **`MATLAB_ONLY_ANSWER.md`** - Your MATLAB question
3. **`docs/GOLF_VIDEO_BUDGET_GUIDE.md`** - Costs explained

### Recommended (45 minutes)
4. **`DEVELOPMENT_START.md`** - Setup guide
5. **`VS_CODE_SETUP.md`** - VS Code help
6. **`docs/GOLF_VIDEO_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES.md`** - Languages

### Reference (as needed)

## 🎓 For Your First Foray

### Don't Worry!

**TypeScript/JavaScript is similar to Python**, so you'll pick it up quickly:

**Python**:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**TypeScript** (similar!):
```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### I've Created Rules for You

I've created **`.cursor/rules/webdevrules.md`** with TypeScript/JavaScript development guidelines that mirror your Python/MATLAB rules:
- ✅ Type safety requirements
- ✅ Component structure standards
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Documentation requirements
- ✅ Testing requirements

### I'll Help Every Step

- ✅ I'll explain concepts as we build
- ✅ I'll help debug issues
- ✅ I'll guide you through each feature
- ✅ I'll answer questions anytime

## 🎯 First Tasks When Ready

Once `npm install` completes:

### 1. Test Everything Works
```bash
npm run dev
# Should start without errors
# Should show: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Read Development Rules
```bash
# Open in VS Code
code .cursor/rules/webdevrules.md
```

### 3. Start Building Phase 1 Features

**Week 1-2**: Learn basics
**Week 3-4**: Build video upload
**Week 5-6**: Build video player
**Week 7-8**: Add drawing tools
**Week 9-10**: Add auth & projects

See `docs/GOLF_VIDEO_ACTION_PLAN.md` for complete plan.
