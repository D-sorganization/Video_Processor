# Video Processor Replicants Version

This folder contains the complete contents of the `claude/Video_Processor_Replicants` branch, which has been extracted and preserved as a separate version of the video processing tools.

## What is this?

The replicants branch contained an alternative implementation or enhanced version of the video processor that was developed separately from the main branch. Rather than keeping it isolated on a branch, this version has been extracted and placed in this dedicated folder so it can be preserved and accessed alongside the main implementation.

## Contents

This folder contains a complete, self-contained version of the video processor including:

- Advanced video processing algorithms and effects
- Real-time video filtering and enhancement tools
- Video format conversion and manipulation utilities
- Computer vision and analysis capabilities
- Configuration files and setup scripts
- Comprehensive documentation and usage guides
- Test suites and sample videos for validation

## Usage

This version can be used independently from the main video processor. Refer to the `README.md` file in this folder for specific setup and usage instructions for this version.

## Relationship to Main Branch

This represents a snapshot of the Video Processor replicants branch as it existed when extracted. Any future development on this version should be done within this folder structure, while the main video processor continues to evolve in the root directory.
